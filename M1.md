Python is one of the most readable languages as its syntax is close to classic pseudocode which makes it easy to read.

With many beginners, the first line of code that is ran is usallly a print statement with the text/string "Hello World". 
For python, the keyword `print` is used to print information onto the console. Code may look like this:

```print("Hello World")```
