## Question A

You are being asked to make a program that suggests a movie to watch based on the user's favorite genre.

This how you will make it:

- You will ask the user for their name and ask them for their favorite genre in movies.
- Depending on what genre they reply with, you will print out a movie you recommend they watch
    - They have to pick from these four options: 
    1. ***Drama***
    2. ***Horror***
    3. ***Comedy***
    4. ***Action***
    - Their input should NOT be case sensitive
    - If their input does not exist with the options

*User input is in* **bold**.
