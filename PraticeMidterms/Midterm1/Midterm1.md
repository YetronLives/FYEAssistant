## Question 2

Your grandmother loves making large amounts of bread for her retirement community, but she is not really good with math. To help her, you will create a program that takes in the amount of yeast, water, flour, and salt in grams and calculates the total amount of full servings of bread she can make.

You need to create a function that takes in the amounts of all ingredients and outputs the total number of full servings of bread she can bake. To make one serving of bread, you need:

- **Flour**: 600 grams
- **Water**: 300 grams
- **Yeast**: 100 grams
- **Salt**: 10 grams

### Example:

Input the amounts of ingredients:

- How much flour do you have in grams: **1900**  
- How much water do you have in grams: **2100**  
- How much yeast do you have in grams: **325**  
- How much salt do you have in grams: **60**  

**Output:**

You can make 3 full servings of bread with the current amount of ingredients.


  
  
  


## Question 3

We are going to make a guessing game. Please create a function that allows the user to play a game. In our game, we first want to ask the user to enter a question and then the corresponding answer. This should be repeated three times to create three questions.

Next, we want to prompt the user with each question and ask for their answer. In the end, we want to print out their total score out of 3.

### Example:

1. Please enter question 1: **What is my favorite color**  
   Please enter the answer to **question 1: White**

2. Please enter question 2: **How old am I**  
   Please enter the answer to question 2: **20**

3. Please enter question 3: **What is my favorite language**  
   Please enter the answer to question 3: **Python**

**Output:**

What is my favorite color: **White**  
How old am I: **20**  
What is my favorite language: **Java**  

You got 2 out of 3 correct!
