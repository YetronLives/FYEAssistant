## Question 1

Make a function that takes in any odd number and prints a diamond pattern with the given height. 

Ex 1. 

Input:

Enter an odd height: **3**

Output:

```
 *
***
 *
```

Ex 2. 

Input:

Enter an odd height: **5**

Output:

```
  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *
```




## Question 2

We will be making a calculator. To do this, you need to implement 7 different functions;

Add:  This function returns the sum of two numbers 
Subtract: This function returns the difference of two  numbers
Multiply: This function returns the product of two numbers
Divide: This function returns the quotient of two numbers
Remainder: This function returns the remainder of two numbers after division
Most: This function returns the greatest of two given numbers
Least: This function returns the minimum of two given numbers

You will then print a menu and ask the user what they would like to do, such as 

```
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Remainder
6. Most
7. Least
8. Quit
What would you like to do: 
```

Depending on what the user picks, you should call the corresponding function and print out the result, as such

```
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Remainder
6. Most
7. Least
8. Quit
What would you like to do: 1

What is the first number: 5
What is the second number: 12

The sum is: 17

1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Remainder
6. Most
7. Least
8. Quit
What would you like to do: 3

What is the first number: 3
What is the second number: 6

The product is 18

1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Remainder
6. Most
7. Least
8. Quit
What would you like to do: 3

What is the first number: 3
What is the second number: 6

The product is 18


1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Remainder
6. Most
7. Least
8. Quit
What would you like to do: 8
