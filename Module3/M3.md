# Module 3
## Functions
Functions are one of the most important parts of programming. A function is just a grouping of code that can be called at any point in your program. Functions are used because they allow us to simplify our code. To make a function in Python all we need to do is use the `def` keyword then make an identifier for our function and finally write the code that we want the function to execute whenever it is called, for example:

```
# Whenever this function is called it will ask for your name and print it.
def printName():
	name = input("Enter your name: ")
	print(name)
```

Once a function is defined we can use it anywhere in our program, we do this by referencing the function, for example we can call the `printName` function we just made like this:
```
# This calls the function that we made earlier and executes the code inside of it
printName()
```


## Function Arguments

Functions can take in arguments such as numbers or strings and do things with them, we do this by putting some variable name inside the parenthesis when defining the function as such:

```
# This function takes in a variable and prints out that it is your name
def printName(name):
	print(f"Your name is {name}"
```

We can then run 

```
printName("John")

# or

personOneName = "John"
printName(personOneName)

# Both of these examples will print (Your name is John)
```

Something that always trips people up is that you can name the argument whatever you want, in my example I called the input name, but you can call it x, or y, or thisIsThePersonsNameThatIWantToPrint, it does not matter, it is just a reference to the variable that you pass to it. To further drive my point I will show some code that is specificily defines the type that the function is expecting, you do not have to do this.

```
# whatevery you pass in will be referenced in the function as personsName
def printName(personsName: str):
	print(f"Your name is {personsName}")

printName("David")
```

In this example I explicity told the function that whatever is passed in needs to be of type string, so anything that is a string can be passed in as an argument, that argument will the be referenced as personsName throughout the function as defined.
